## Data Structures and Algorithms
  <P> This repo contains Python code implementing fundamental data structurs and algorithms, along with solutions to specific programming challenges.</p>
   

 ## Stacks
  Q1 : <p>Balanced Expressions</p>
  <p>mplement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets and determines whether the expression is balanced</p>


  ## Sequences(Lists/Tuples)
   Q.2<br>
     <p>Remove Duplicates</p>
   <p>Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates removed while maintaining the original order of elements.</p>


# Dictionaries
Q.3 <p>Word Frequency</p>

<p>Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the sentence. Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
